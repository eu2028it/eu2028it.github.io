<h1>This is not the 2028 Italian EU Council Presidency.</h1>
Every six months, the Presidency of the EU Council rotates to a different member state. When the presidency rotates to a certain
member state, said state is supposed to create a website at eu[year].[state TLD]. For example, in the latter half of 2017, when the
presidency was held by Estonia, the website was eu2017.ee. Most countries register theirs years in advance. Unfortunately, Italy,
who has the presidency in 2028, forgot to. We decided to do it for them.
